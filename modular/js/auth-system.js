  auth-system.js — RETIRED 2026-02-20 by Claude

  This file was creating duplicate user documents with auto-generated IDs
  and role:'pending', then triggering window.location.reload() in a loop,
  causing sign-in state and role assignments to break for all users.

  It has been replaced by aa-firebase.js (compat SDK, loaded via shared-header).
  This stub is intentionally empty so that any browser still loading this file
  from a cached version of shared-header.html does no harm.

// No-op: all auth is handled by aa-firebase.js
console.log('[auth-system.js] retired stub loaded — no action taken.');
